# Adobe Experience Platform APIs

This set of Postman Collections corresponds to the public [Adobe Experience Platform APIs](https://www.adobe.io/apis/experienceplatform/home/api-reference.html).

These Postman Collections have been set up to share the Postman Variable collections generated via __[Adobe I/O Console's Integrations](https://console.adobe.io/integrations) > Export Details to Postman__, which generates a Postman Environment file with the selected integrations values.


## Obtaining an Access Token to access the Adobe Experience Platform APIs

To obtain a valid access token to interact with the APIs in these Postman Collections, use the provided [Adobe I/O Access Token Generation.postman_collection.json](../ims).

The __Adobe I/O Access Token Generation Postman Collection__ is compatible with the __Export Details to Postman__ from Adobe I/O Console. Note that the only Postman Environment variable you will have to provide is the `PRIVATE_KEY`.
